                <p>As part of the Robocon 2020 competition, I collaborated with my team to design and develop two manual robots for the “Robo Rugby” theme. 
                    Our innovative approach and meticulous design earned us a perfect score of 100/100 for idea and design evaluation during the national assessment.</p>
                <p>The competition challenged teams to design robots capable of simulating a rugby match. 
                    Robots needed to pick up and pass rugby balls, navigate the field, and score goals by successfully placing the balls in designated scoring zones.  </p>

                <p><strong style="font-size: 1.35em;"><em>Robot 1: Ball Carrier</em></strong></p>
                <p>The first robot was designed as a ball carrier, capable of picking up rugby balls from the starting area and delivering them to the scoring zones. 
                    The robot featured a mechanically robust gripping system for secure ball handling and precise release, ensuring consistent performance. 
                    Its agile drive system allowed for rapid movement across the field, minimizing time delays.</p>
                <p><strong style="font-size: 1.35em;"><em>Robot 2: Goal Scorer</em></strong></p>
                <p>The second robot was optimized for scoring tasks. 
                    Equipped with a specialized mechanism for receiving rugby balls and a goal-shooting system, it could accurately place the balls into designated scoring zones. 
                    The robots efficient maneuvering capabilities and precise control mechanisms ensured high accuracy during gameplay.</p>
                <p>Both robots were designed to work in coordination, adhering strictly to the rules of the game while optimizing task completion. 
                    The project highlighted our ability to integrate mechanical design, control systems, and game strategy to achieve an optimal solution for the competition. 
                    Our design philosophy prioritized reliability, precision, and efficiency, which were critical in earning full marks for idea and design.</p>
