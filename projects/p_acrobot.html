    <p>
        The goal of this project was to design a control strategy that enables an Acrobot to perform a swing-up maneuver 
        from the downward stable position to the unstable upright position, and then stabilize at the top. This project 
        demonstrates the integration of energy shaping, optimal control, and switching strategies on a highly non-linear system.

    <p>
        An energy-based controller was implemented to gradually increase the Acrobotâ€™s total energy, bringing it to the 
        upright configuration. Once near the top, control was switched to a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), designed from 
        the linearized dynamics around the equilibrium point, to stabilize the system.
