    <p>
        A mobile robotic manipulator is deveoloped to automate harvesting tasks in vertical farms. 
        The system features a 5-DOF manipulator mounted on a mecanum-wheeled base, equipped with a custom multipurpose 
        end-effector that combines adaptive gripping and precision cutting mechanism for safe and efficient crop handling.

    <p>
        Using a Kinect depth camera, the robot performs real-time crop detection and localization, traverse through multiple 
        vertical layers via a lift mechanism. A working prototype, paired with a scaled vertical farm model, successfully demonstrated 
        the autonomous harvesting of brinjal crops.
