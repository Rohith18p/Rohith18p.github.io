                    <p>As part of a groundbreaking research project, I developed a mobile robotic manipulator to automate harvesting tasks in vertical farms, a promising solution for sustainable agriculture. 
                        The system integrates a 5-DOF serial manipulator mounted on a mecanum-wheeled mobile base, equipped with a novel multipurpose end-effector. 
                        This end-effector combines a gripper with adaptable fingers and a precision cutting mechanism for efficient and safe vegetable harvesting.</p>
                    <p> Using a Kinect depth camera, the robot performs real-time detection and localization of crops, solving inverse kinematics to ensure precise motion control. 
                        The system operates across vertical farm layers via a lift mechanism, optimizing space and reducing labor costs.</p>
                    <p>A prototype of a vertical farm and the robot was developed and tested, successfully demonstrating the automated harvesting of brinjal crops. 
                        Future plans include incorporating IoT-based monitoring for environmental conditions and expanding capabilities to planting and inspection tasks, enhancing the efficiency of modern farming systems.</p>
