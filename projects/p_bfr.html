        Developed a compact ball-following robot that integrates computer vision, IoT-based control, 
        and real-time decision-making for autonomous tracking. A smartphone mounted on the robot streams video 
        to an external system, where contour detection isolates the ball and calculates its position. Based on this, 
        the robot adjusts its direction and speed, approaching the target until proximity is reached. 
        A NodeMCU controller manages motor commands over Wi-Fi, enabling smooth and responsive operation.
