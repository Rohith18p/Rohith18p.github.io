    <p>
        I designed and developed three holonomic bases tailored for different robotic applications: 
        a four-wheeled mecanum drive for smooth omnidirectional motion, a four-wheeled omni drive for enhanced maneuverability 
        and stability, and a compact three-wheeled omni drive optimized for precise control in constrained spaces.

        All platforms were powered by encoder motors with PID control, ensuring accurate feedback and highly responsive navigation, 
        operated via joystick or RC controller. Especially for the tri-wheel omni drive, I overcame unique 
        control challenges to achieve seamless 360Â° mobility comparable to conventional 4-wheel systems. These works highlight 
        my expertise in mechatronics, motion control, and robotics system design
