        Developed a fully dexterous robotic hand capable of in-hand manipulation and pick-and-place tasks, 
        implementing and testing various control algorithms. The prototype features three fingers at a 1:1.5 scale 
        of the human hand, actuated with Dynamixel motors, along with a custom thumb mechanism enabling abduction 
        and adduction for enhanced dexterity.
