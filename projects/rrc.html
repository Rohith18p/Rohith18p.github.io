<ul>
    <li>Engineered multiple bionic arms by implementing a range of systems, including under-actuated, fully actuated, and fully dexterous configurations.</li>
    <li>Designed a bipedal robot with proportions and actuations closely mimicking human characteristics.</li>
    <li>Current work involves simulation of dynamic walking of the bipedal robot in Gazebo using ROS.</li>
    <li>Cultivated extensive experience in rapid prototyping by 3D printing (FDM, SLA, SLS).</li>
