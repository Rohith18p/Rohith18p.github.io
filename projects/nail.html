  <ul class="experience-points">
    <li>Conducted real-world hardware experiments with the Contingency MPPI (C-MPPI) algorithm to enable real-time, risk-aware trajectory planning in dynamic and uncertain environments.</li>
    <li>Extended the C-MPPI framework by integrating adversary detection and dynamic field-of-view (FOV) estimation, allowing for visibility-aware planning in partially observable environments.</li>
    <li>Developed and deployed a ROS 2-based pipeline for real-time safe zone extraction using occupancy grid transformations, integrated with JAX-accelerated nested MPPI rollouts for efficient, hardware-in-the-loop planning.</li>
    <li>Implemented automatic safe zone detection using occlusion-aware estimation and embedded it within the C-MPPI framework, ensuring paths consistently remain within reach of safe zones under contingency triggers.</li>
    <li>Validated an algorithmic guarantee that the robot can replan and reach a safe zone within a bounded time horizon, enabling provably safe and adaptive navigation.</li>
