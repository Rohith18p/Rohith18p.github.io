      This project implements Contingency-MPPI, a motion planning framework that embeds contingency planning within a standard 
      Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller to ensure safety in dynamic environments. At each step, the planner generates 
      both a nominal trajectory and a contingency backup path to a safe region, enabling robust responses to sudden changes.

      I further implemented occlusion-based safe zone detection, allowing the robot to plan dynamically around unseen areas rather than 
      relying on predefined safe zones. Validated in simulation and hardware with LiDAR-inertial localization, Contingency-MPPI 
      achieved real-time, risk-aware trajectory planning with improved safety and adaptability.
