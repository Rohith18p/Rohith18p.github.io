        This project focused on trajectory planning and obstacle avoidance for robotic manipulation. 
        In simulation, smooth paths were generated between start and goal positions using multiple inverse kinematics 
        approaches (analytical, solver-based, and gradient descent). Obstacle avoidance was implemented through geometric 
        methods with safety offsets as well as an A* grid-based planner to compute optimal collision-free trajectories.

        In the real-world stage, an overhead vision system with AprilTags was used to dynamically detect objects, 
        goals, and obstacles. The computed trajectories were then executed on the PincherX-100 manipulator, enabling precise 
        and collision-free pick-and-place operations.
