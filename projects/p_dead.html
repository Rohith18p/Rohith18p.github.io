        This project focused on implementing dead reckoning for vehicle trajectory estimation by fusing data from a GPS puck 
        and a Vector VN100 IMU using custom ROS2 drivers. Extensive experiments were conducted to characterize sensor performance, 
        including stationary and linear motion tests for GPS and Allan variance analysis for IMU noise and drift.

        The pipeline included IMU calibration through circular driving to correct magnetometer errors, 
        followed by real-world street tests. A complementary filter was applied to combine IMU and GPS data, 
        producing refined estimates of heading, velocity, and position.
        This work highlights the integration of sensor calibration, filtering, and fusion for reliable vehicle localization.
